# YACR (Yet Another Copr Repository)

This is a **COPR** repository for free/non-free packages that don't have the privilege
of receiving auto-updates. Or are not available in the official Fedora repositories.

## Installation Instructions

To install this Copr repository simply run,

```txt
dnf copr enable -y zliced13/YACR
```

## Package Requests

If you want to request a new package to be added, then create a new issue using the **package-request** template.

<!-- spellcheck ignore -->
If the requested package already works fine in other Linux package managers (including but not limited to
**AM** (App Manager), **HomeBrew**, **NixPkgs**, **Flatpak**, and **Snap**) then it most likely not
be added unless there is a really good reason for why it should be added this COPR repository.
